## <a name="question"></a> Got a Question or Problem?

You can start a discussion thread on GitHub Discussions linked with this library found at [amconfig Discussions](https://github.com/konidev20/amconfig/discussions)

GitHub issues are only for [reporting bugs](#issue) and [feature requests](#feature), not
questions or help.

## <a name="issue"></a> Found an Issue?

If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help by
submitting an issue to the [GitHub Repository][github]. Even better you can submit a Pull Request
with a fix.

When submitting an issue please include the following information:

- A description of the issue which includes the amconfig version
- The Operating system and the architecture
- The exception message 
- If possible, please include code that reproduces the issue. [DropBox][dropbox] or GitHub's
[Gist][gist] can be used to share large code samples, or you could
[submit a pull request](#pullrequest) with the issue reproduced in a new test.

The more information you include about the issue, the more likely it is to be fixed!

## <a name="pullrequest"></a> Submitting a Pull Request

When submitting a pull request to the [GitHub Repository][github] make sure to do the following:

- Please adhere to the existing coding pattern in the project. It should be straight-forward to absorb.
- Ensure that the unit test coverage is more than 80%
- Write appropriate code samples in the documentation. (README.md)
- Add the summary of the issue in the changelog

Read [GitHub Help][pullrequesthelp] for more details about creating pull requests.
